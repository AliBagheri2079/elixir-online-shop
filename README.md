An Online Shop site template, implemented with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev/). Styled with [Post CSS](https://postcss.org/). This is one of my portfolios, but I would be pleased if these codes helped others, so I published it as an open-source project. feel free to explore it, and if you need help, ask me. I would respond as soon as possible.
